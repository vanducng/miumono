## Release Management

Release management is handled by release-please automation. Simply:

1. Use conventional commits: `feat(miu-core): add feature`
2. Merge to main
3. Review and merge the auto-generated release PR

See [release-please workflow](../.github/workflows/release-please.yml) for details.

## Utility Scripts

- `install.sh` - Unix/macOS installation script
